= Validation Scenario

This plugin is based on ideas of the http://code.google.com/p/validation-scenarios/ plugin. The name does fit for the problem which is solved with the plugin, so i'm to lazy to find another one (just rubified it and asking for re-usage of the name).


= Rails Support

The tests are running with the following Rails versions:
* 2.1.0
* 2.1.1

You may run the test suite with the RAILS_GEM_VERSION environment variable set to a valid Rails::VERSION, like
  
  RAILS_GEM_VERSION=2.1 rake test


= Howto

Define validates_xxx methods on a Model for scenarios. The validation will only occur, if the
Model is used in a scenario:

  Model:
    class Event < ActiveRecord::Base
      validates_presence_of :title

      in_scenario :reviewer do |s|
         s.validates_presence_of :reviewer_note
      end

  Controller:
    class ReviewController < ApplicationController
      def create
        @event = Event.new(params[:event])
        @event.save!
      end

      def update
        with_scenario :reviewer do
          @event.save!
        end
      end

The :symbol given to #in_scenario is the identifier for the scenario, which is then activated
via the #with_scenario block.
